I am a student at BMSTU, studying in the direction of "Computer systems for industrial automation". I am passionate about machine learning.

In secondary school, I actively participated in physics, mathematics and informational Olympiads,
which helped me to pass exams well with an average score of 93 and 100 points for physics and to enter the Bauman Moscow State Technical University.

Already at the university, I took on the role of deputy Student Union of the faculty, for this and exemplary study I receive an increased scholarship,
the average score for sessions is 4.8

Able to quickly get used to a topic that is new to himself.
The level of English and knowledge in modern deep learning algorithms allows you to quickly read the latest article on arXiv.com, isolate the main idea and convey to the team.
