Hi!

My name is Stepan. I am machine learning engineer\data scientist.
For the past two years, I have worked in the finance unit of Sber, Russia's largest bank.
Participated in the full planning, development, implementation of the model into banking processes.

Worked mostly in python and a little bit of C++.
SQL - PyTorch - Spark e.t.c other DS frameworks

Some time ago, I graduated from BMSTU with a degree in "Computer systems for industrial automation". I am also currently pursuing a master's degree at HSE in the field of Financial Technologies and Data Analysis.

The level of English and knowledge in modern deep learning algorithms allows you to quickly read the latest article on arXiv.com, isolate the main idea and convey to the team.

Courses attended:
  Karpov_cources: HardML

  Coursera: Specialization Machine Learning and Data Analysis from MIPT and Yandex
            Finding structure in data from Computer Science Center
            Bayesian Statistics: Techniques and Models from the Higher School of Economic
